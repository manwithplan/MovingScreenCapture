# MovingScreenCapture
 A python script that detects a video window on your screen, and opens a new opencv window looking at it.
 
 Currently the variable BoundingBox is set up so you're looking at the right half of your screen, make sure there are no windows overlapping in it for optimal results.
 
 This script works best on a second screen, and can be useful for automating opencv actions on in-browser video.
